        <h2>Welcome to Damascus</h2>
        <p>Damascus is the capital of Syria, a country in the Middle East. It is one of the world’s oldest cities. For thousands of years Damascus has been an important trading center. Today it is also Syria’s center of education and culture.</p>
        <p>Over the centuries, Damascus has been conqueror and conquered, wealthy and destitute, and capital of empire and small states. Its fame has been sustained by its continuous prominence as a commercial and intellectual centre. Its life has been nourished periodically by immigrants from the hinterland and from the Mediterranean Basin and Southwest Asia.</p>
